# arci
interactive stage performances via smartphone

arci is in active developement and is _not_ yet recommended for productive use. Feel free to experiment with it though :)

Developement by [bleeptrack](https://www.bleeptrack.de) and [Henrike Iglesias](https://www.instagram.com/henrikeiglesiasinsta).

# Requirements

- webserver:
  - running node and npm
  - capable of serving static files (f.e. nginx)
  - reachable in your local network or publicly, depending on your use case

# Installation

Clone the repo and run

```npm install```



In the cloned folder, you will find a file called ```config.json```. Here, set the information as follows:

```absolute-static-file-path``` is the path to a folder where your static files can be served
```port``` is the port number that the arci server can run on

# Usage

Start the server with ```npm run```

You can now open the arci control page at ```http://<your-domain>/control```.
Create your cues, order them in the cue list and when you are ready, start a session with the "start session" button. Only then people are able to connect.

Guide your audience to ```http://<your-domain>/seat/```

In case people on stage need to be assigned a certain participant ID, then guide them to ```http://<your-domain>/seat/<ID>```

# Creating custom Interaction Types

You can create your own Interaction Types by adding a file to the ```public/InteractionTypes/``` folder on your server. A template with description of available methods can be found in ```interaction-template.js```.
